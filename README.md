# tandem plant tracker
keep up with your plants and make sure they don't miss a watering!
This app was created as part of an application for a software engineering apprentice position at [Tandem](https://madeintandem.com)
The prompt was to create an app that generates a 12 week watering schedule for a given set of plants. Each plant has a specified 'water after x number of days' property, but it's okay to be watered the day before or after. No plants are to be watered on the weekends because work/life balance is important!
